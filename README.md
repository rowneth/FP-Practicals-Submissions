I wrote this Scala code to handle basic calculations. 
It includes functions to find the area of a circle given its radius, convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit, and calculate the volume of a sphere using its radius.
Additionally, it determines the total cost of buying books in bulk, considering discounts and shipping costs. 
For running, it calculates the time it takes to cover distances at different speeds. 
With this code, inputting the necessary values gives me the answers I need quickly.
